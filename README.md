# Distributed Robotic Behavior Layer
The Distributed Robotic Behavior Layer implements Pursuit and Evasion behaviors for real-world ROS robots and for simulation. The project began during the summer of 2014 at the Naval Postgraduate School

## General usage
### Stage behavior simulation
Set up your environment variables (`ROS_HOSTNAME` and `ROS_MASTER_URI`) for a local master as per the ROS wiki.
To toggle to a local master for just the current terminal, run
    export ROS_HOSTNAME=`hostname -I`; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_HOSTNAME:11311
If you followed the NPS ARSENL Yoda wiki for Robotic Laser tag to set up your environment variables, you should that aliased to `local_ros`, which I recommend you set if you are going to be toggling between physical and simulated robots. Otherwise, feel free to set those variables to localhost for pure simulation.

Launch Stage in one terminal (automatically starts roscore):
    roslaunch husky_pursuit stage.launch

Run a behavior in another terminal:
    roslaunch husky_pursuit seek_control_flee.launch
See the `Description of project contents` section for the game behavior launches. With a control launch, use a joystick plugged into your computer.

### Physical robot
First (example host IP):
    ssh ros@192.168.1.125
    roscore
Then:
    roslaunch husky_pursuit system.launch
You can select the behaviors in system.launch when including behaviors.launch, as well as configure max linear and angular speed.

Recommended - also run `rqt_console` to monitor log messages and possibly `rqt_graph` to view node and topic connections.

### Behaviors

Movement manager
* Take relay responsibility from safety controller  
  * Safety controller instead continues to publish status  
  * Movement manager sucks in status and then responds (eg relaying, avoiding)  
* Compose behaviors, steering behaviors together, priority  

Obstacle avoidance
Arrival
Pursuit and Evasion on physical robots
Gazebo individual control launch file (straightforward, I just first need to fix some issue with four_sim.launch having robots fall through the ground)

### Simulation testing - testing different behaviors against each other

* Set up testing argument files - eg:
  * seek_vs_flee.csv: <pre>
max_lin, max_ang, max_lin, max_ang
0.5, 0.3, 0.3, 0.5
0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5
...
</pre>
  * Simulate phidget_driver.py damage
  * Measure/compare time to destruction. Really testing deltas in velocity limits and the performance of behaviors/composed behaviors

### Architecture
Convert system to use rocon-multimaster for hydro.  
Dynamic reconfigure/parameter server support for nodes, especially the behaviors.  
Split behaviors off into a steering_behaviors package - this is a specialized usage of that

## Troubleshooting
### Joystick not working
If you have a CH Products flightstick, try running:
    sudo lsusb -v
Check joystick output with:
	jstest /dev/input/js0
